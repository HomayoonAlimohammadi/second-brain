- **Objective**: Enable service owners to distribute service parameters for automatic adoption by service clients.

- **Format and Conversion**:
  - Defined in `grpc.service_config.ServiceConfig` protocol buffer message.
  - Internally represented in JSON, converted from protobuf via standard rules:
    - Snake_case to camelCase for field names.
    - Protobuf to JSON translation for field values (e.g., strings, integers, bools, arrays).
    - 64-bit integers represented as strings.
    - `google.protobuf.Duration` represented as decimal seconds string.

- **Unique JSON Representation Advantage**:
  - JSON form supports configurations for unknown LB policies beyond built-in options, allowing selection of third-party policies through arbitrary strings.

- **Architecture**:
  - Service config is tied to a server name and provided by the name resolver plugin alongside resolved addresses.
  - Resolvers return the service config in JSON, sourced from protobuf conversion, direct JSON, or dynamically constructed from other data.

- **Resolver Plugin and Service Configs**:
  - Resolver implementations determine the service configâ€™s storage and format.
  - DNS resolver plugin specifics for service configs are detailed in gRFC A2.

- **Example Service Config**:
  - **Protobuf Form**:
    - Specifies `round_robin` LB policy.
    - Applies method config for specific methods and services with a default timeout.
      
      ```protobuf
      {
		  // Use round_robin LB policy.
		  load_balancing_config: { round_robin: {} }
		  // This method config applies to method "foo/bar" and to all methods
		  // of service "baz".
		  method_config: {
		    name: {
		      service: "foo"
		      method: "bar"
		    }
		    name: {
		      service: "baz"
		    }
		    // Default timeout for matching methods.
		    timeout: {
		      seconds: 1
		      nanos: 1
		    }
		  }
	  }
	  ```
      
      
  - **JSON Form**:
    - Illustrates the JSON representation of the protobuf example, highlighting the format and content differences.
      
      ```json
      {
		  "loadBalancingConfig": [ { "round_robin": {} } ],
		  "methodConfig": [
		    {
		      "name": [
		        { "service": "foo", "method": "bar" },
		        { "service": "baz" }
		      ],
		      "timeout": "1.000000001s"
		    }
		  ]
	  }
	```

- **APIs Utilization**:
  - Used in the resolver API for returning the service config to the gRPC client.
  - Available in the gRPC client API for querying and explicitly setting the service config, useful for debugging, unit testing, and setting default configs.

## Service Config via DNS

- **Objective**: Introduce a mechanism for embedding gRPC service config in DNS, facilitating automatic configuration usage by all service clients.

- **Background**: Originally designed for Google's internal use, the service config mechanism works well in the open-source domain, except for the DNS encoding part, which this document addresses.

- **Proposal Summary**:
  - **Canarying Changes**: Allows for gradual rollout of service config changes through criteria-based selection among multiple config choices. This approach supports testing new configurations on a subset of clients based on language, percentage, and hostname.
  
  - **DNS TXT Record Encoding**:
    - Service config data is encoded in DNS using TXT records with the attribute name `grpc_config`. 
    - The attribute value is a JSON list representing service config choices.
      ```json
        // A list of one or more service config choices.
		// The first matching entry wins.
		[
		  {
			// Criteria used to select this choice.
			// If a field is absent or empty, it matches all clients.
			// All fields must match a client for this choice to be selected.
			// If any unexpected field name is present in this object, the entire
			// config is considered invalid.
			//
			// Client language(s): a list of strings (e.g., "c++", "java", "go",
			// "python", etc).  Each string is case insensitive.
			"clientLanguage": [string],
			// Percentage: integer from 0 to 100 indicating the percentage of
			// clients that should use this choice.  If present, the number must
			// match the regular expression `^0|[0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|100$`
			// All other numbers are considered invalid.
			"percentage": number,
			// Client hostname(s): a list of strings.  Each name is case 
			// sensitive and must be an exact match of the hostname according to
			// the system.
			"clientHostname": [string],
		
			// The service config data object for clients that match the above
			// criteria.  (The format for this object is defined in
			// https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/service_config.md.)
			// If this field is not an object, or is missing, or is otherwise 
			// invalid, the entire config is considered invalid.
			"serviceConfig": object
		  }
		]
	  ```
    - TXT records are named with a `_grpc_config.` prefix followed by the gRPC server name.

- **Example**: 
  - For a server named "myserver," a TXT record might look like `_grpc_config.myserver 3600 TXT "grpc_config=[{...}]"`, containing JSON-formatted service config data:
    ```bash
    _grpc_config.myserver  3600  TXT "grpc_config=[{\"serviceConfig\":{\"loadBalancingPolicy\":\"round_robin\",\"methodConfig\":[{\"name\":[{\"service\":\"MyService\",\"method\":\"Foo\"}],\"waitForReady\":true}]}}]"
	```
  
- **Rationale**: 
  - Embedding the service config in DNS aligns with its role in name resolution. 
  - TXT records are used for their suitability in carrying metadata.
  - The `_grpc_config` prefix allows compatibility with services using CNAME records.

- **Implementation**: 
  - Completed in C-core with ongoing efforts to make the c-ares resolver the default DNS resolver, including adding support for various platforms and features like address sorting.

- **Considerations and Open Issues**: 
  - DNS limitations such as the fallback to TCP for responses over 512 bytes and the absolute maximum response size of 65535 bytes could impact the design.
  - Feedback is sought on whether DNS's inherent limitations pose significant drawbacks to this approach.
