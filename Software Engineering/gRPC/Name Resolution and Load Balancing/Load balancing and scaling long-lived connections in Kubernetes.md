- **Kubernetes Load Balancing Challenge**:
  - Kubernetes services do not effectively load balance long-lived connections such as HTTP/2, gRPC, RSockets, AMQP, or database connections.
  - The issue results in uneven request distribution across Pods, with some Pods receiving more traffic than others.

- **Kubernetes Services and Deployments**:
  - Deployments manage the replication and scaling of apps as Pods.
  - Services act like load balancers, distributing traffic across a set of Pods.

- **Load Balancing Mechanism**:
  - Kubernetes uses kube-proxy and iptables to direct traffic to Pods without an actual load balancing process.
  - Load balancing strategy is effectively random due to iptables' use of the statistic module, not truly round-robin.

- **Long-Lived Connections and Scaling**:
  - Persistent connections reuse a single TCP connection for multiple requests, improving latency and resource utilization but bypassing iptables-based load balancing.
  - This leads to all traffic being sent to the same Pod once a connection is established.

- **Client-Side Load Balancing Solution**:
  - Implement client-side load balancing by fetching a list of service endpoints and distributing requests among them.
  - This approach requires maintaining a connection pool and periodically refreshing the list of endpoints based on service changes.

- **Service Meshes as a Solution**:
  - Service meshes like Istio or Linkerd can automatically handle service discovery and request load balancing for long-lived connections.
  - They provide a standardized way to manage traffic within the cluster, though they add complexity and overhead.

- **Summary**:
  - While Kubernetes excels at managing stateless, short-lived connections, it lacks native support for efficiently load balancing long-lived TCP connections.
  - Developers need to implement client-side load balancing or use service meshes to ensure even traffic distribution and effective use of resources for applications relying on persistent connections.
